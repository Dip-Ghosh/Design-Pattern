# Design Pattern in PHP & Laravel

## Creational Design Patterns
>Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms,which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

#### Singleton ( [Details](singleton/singleton-details.md) ) 

#### Simple Factory ( [Details](simple-factory/simple-factory.md) )
#### Factory Method ( [Details](factory-method/factory-design-pattern.md) )
#### Abstract Factory ( [Details](simple-factory/simple-factory.md) )

[//]: # (#### Static Factory &#40; [Details]&#40;simple-factory/simple-factory.md&#41; &#41;)

[//]: # (#### Pool &#40; [Details]&#40;simple-factory/simple-factory.md&#41; &#41;)

## Structural Design Patterns
>Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Structural Design Patterns are Design Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

[//]: # (#### Flyweight &#40; [Details]&#40;simple-factory/simple-factory.md&#41; &#41;)

[//]: # (#### Proxy &#40; [Details]&#40;simple-factory/simple-factory.md&#41; &#41;)

[//]: # (#### Registry &#40; [Details]&#40;simple-factory/simple-factory.md&#41; &#41;)


## Behavioral Design Patterns

>Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. These are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
#### Strategy ([Details](strategy/Strategy-Pattern-Details.md))

[//]: # (#### Chain Of Responsibilities &#40;[Details]&#40;strategy/Strategy-Pattern-Details.md&#41;&#41;)

[//]: # (#### Interpreter &#40;[Details]&#40;strategy/Strategy-Pattern-Details.md&#41;&#41;)

[//]: # (#### Iterator &#40;[Details]&#40;strategy/Strategy-Pattern-Details.md&#41;&#41;)
